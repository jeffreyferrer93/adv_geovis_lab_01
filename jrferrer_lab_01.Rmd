## Question 2

**For my analysis, I used the `World` dataset from the `tmap` package in R. I was interested**
**in analysing and visualizing how life expectency is influenced by inequality across countries.**
**First I removed NA's from the dataset and plotted the data for 136 countries.**


```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(sf)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggspatial)
library(tmap)
```


```{r, echo = TRUE}
World_subset <- na.omit(World)
inequality <- World_subset$inequality
life_exp <- World_subset$life_exp
{plot(x = inequality, y = life_exp, las = 1, col = 'blue', pch = 19,
  xlab = "Inequality", ylab = "Life Expectancty", main = "Life Expectancy
  as a Function of Inequality for 136 Countries")
abline(lm(life_exp ~ inequality))}
```

**There seems to be a linear relationship between these two variables so**
**I conducted a simple linear regression to analyze the data.**

```{r, echo = FALSE}
summary(lm(life_exp ~ inequality))
```

**From the summary statistic we can see that there is a significant relationship**
**between inequality and life expectancy. More specifically, a 1 unit increase**
**in inequality (presumably the units are based on Gini index, a popular statistical measurement** **of income, wealth, or consumption inequality within a group or country) is associated with**
**a 67 year decrease in life expectancy. Since the Gini index ranges from 0-1, it would**
**be more appropriate to say that a .1 increase in equality is significantly associated**
**with a 6.7 year decrease in life expectancy**

**Now that we know life expectancy is significantly associated with inequality**
**I would like to visualize how variation inlife expectancy is spatially distributed throughout**
**the globe. To do this, I used ``ggplot2`` using the ``heat.colors()`` pallette.**


```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = World, aes(
  fill = life_exp), alpha = .5) + 
  ggtitle("Life Expectancy by Country") + 
  labs(caption = "Created by Jeffrey Ferrer 11/1/2024") +
  scale_fill_gradientn(colours = heat.colors(10), name = "Age") +  
  theme_bw() + theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = .5)) + 
  annotation_north_arrow(height = unit(1, "cm"), width = unit(1,"cm"), pad_y = unit(1.75, "cm"))
```

**By looking at the map, we can easily see that that life expectancy is lowest in third**
**world countries. Since life expectancy is significantly associated with inequality, we know** 
**that these countries also have a high degree of inequality. By combining graphs, statiscal** **analysis, and maps, I was able to create a thorough and informative analysis of life expectancy** **and inequality.**
